Just my projects i've done for my assingments and leet challenges outside my life (Java based).
RMIT Projects in this folder:




# CardGame (Java)
 A similar game of 21. Add players and money at the start. After everyone places their bets (it is a must), each player will have to deal. When all players are dealt, the Bot will deal itself and depending on the score or bust between each player, they respectively gained double or lose their money.
  

# MovieMaster (Java)
Kinda like a library, but with Movies and Games. There are records of Returned and Borrowed items. Users can get fined for returning too late.

# ParticleFind (c++)
Imagine that you are stuck in a place, with no direction of where you are and a map. As you walk, you'll gradually discover your position in the map.
